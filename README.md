The Store app allows the creation and management of product categories and individual products, including details like name, description, price, stock, and size. Customers can add products to a shopping cart (CartItem) with specified quantities and sizes. Orders track the items purchased, the customer making the purchase, the order status (Pending, Paid, Shipped, Cancelled), and timestamps for creation and updates. The system provides a clear overview of inventory, order progress, and supports multiple products per order.
